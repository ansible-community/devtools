We are happy to announce the release of {project} {release}.

# How to get it

You can install the latest version of all the ansible developer tools by running the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip -U install ansible-dev-tools
```

This will install the following developer tools:

- [ansible-builder](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/): Ansible Builder automates the process of building execution environments using the schemas and tooling defined in various Ansible Collections and by the user.
- [ansible-core](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/ansible/): Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy and maintain. Automate everything from code deployment to network configuration to cloud management, in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.
- [ansible-creator](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/creator/): The fastest way to generate all your ansible content!
- [ansible-dev-environment](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/dev-environment/): A pip-like install for Ansible collections.
- [ansible-lint](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/): Checks playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved.
- [ansible-navigator](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/) A text-based user interface (TUI) for Ansible.
- [ansible-sign](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/sign/): Utility for signing and verifying Ansible project directory contents.
- [molecule](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/): Molecule aids in the development and testing of Ansible content: collections, playbooks and roles
- [pytest-ansible](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/pytest-ansible/): A pytest plugin that enables the use of ansible in tests, enables the use of pytest as a collection unit test runner, and exposes molecule scenarios using a pytest fixture.
- [tox-ansible](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/tox-ansible/): The tox-ansible plugin dynamically creates a full matrix of python interpreter and ansible-core version environments for running integration, sanity, and unit for an ansible collection both locally and in a Github action. tox virtual environments are leveraged for collection building, collection installation, dependency installation, and testing.

For a single tool, you can install it by running:

```bash
python3 -m pip -U install <project>==<release>
```

All ansible developer tools are also packaged in an image that you can use as a [VsCode development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). The image is updated shortly after releases of any individual tool.
The [community-dev-tools](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-dev-tools/pkgs/container/community-ansible-dev-tools) image is available on GitHub Container Registry.

```
podman run -it ghcr.io/ansible/community-ansible-dev-tools:latest
```

Sample `devcontainer.json` files are available in the [ansible-dev-tools](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-dev-tools/tree/main/.devcontainer) repository.
